PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS NOT CURRENTLY WORKING CODE. 

The jar listed here is an older working version.

The project compiles with lein compile. A resources folder will need to be created; I did not include it because the data in my resources folder is not publicly available.

The four main files are:
src/core/training.clj
src/core/decoding.clj
src/core/evaluation.clj
src/core/main.clj

This is a work in progress.
